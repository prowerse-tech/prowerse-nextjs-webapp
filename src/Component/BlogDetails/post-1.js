                      Effective product engineering strategy is crucial for
                      businesses for several reasons. It enables the development
                      of products that outperform competitors and responds
                      quickly to market demands.

                  <p>
                    It is very essential to define core pain areas which the
                    product is trying to resolve. Research to get to know whom
                    you are designing for, what are the users trying to achieve,
                    what are pain points and how to fix it. Direct interaction
                    with users, surveys & complains of competitors are key
                    methods to find out pain areas. This phase usually ends up
                    with pile of problems, struggling areas & challenges faced
                    by users. One can easily create ultra large problem
                    definition out of it. Next, it is to churn data of inputs to
                    figure out the most obvious & generic problems faced by all
                    users. Thus, removing all clutters & moving inch closer to
                    achieve Minimum Viable Product definition. Next, it is to
                    prepare rough draft of MVP. Up next, UX prototype gets
                    ready. This has user journey through the system. Many times,
                    a complete set of wireframes can be designed.

                  <p>
                    Execution starts with building POC. A Proof of Concept (POC)
                    is a small exercise to test the product idea. The aim behind
                    POC is to show the functionality and to verify that the
                    proposed solution can be achieved with technology.
                    Technology stack plays a key role at every stage of product
                    development. In early days, the primary goal is to be launch
                    the MVP as quickly as possible. Any language/framework that
                    helps put together a working prototype in the shortest
                    possible time should be a good fit. Next is to test the MVP.
                    There are multiple ways testing can be approached. It
                    usually starts with testing of concept as a whole and later
                    details in to the testing of features, user flow & visual
                    design. At this moment, the product is ready for the launch.

                    Once the product is accepted by targeted users, the
                    especially important phase of sustainability starts. There
                    are many paradigms of sustainability. One way is to
                    continuously optimize technical implementation to keep
                    product performance with ever-increasing number of users. It
                    can be shorter response times, improved UX, getting
                    technical architecture in place or an efficient data access
                    engine. With many users comes many feature requests. It is
                    very apt to completely test out the product with every build
                    release. These tests are known as regressions and usually
                    needs to be automated with no-code or code-less testing
                    frameworks. This phase is for infinite duration. One must
                    have sustainability strategy to keep product ever ready to
                    meet market demands. Lastly, many teams invest efforts to
                    set up fantastic customer happiness teams. This team becomes
                    customer advocate within product teams.

                    Product need to reinvent itself every few years to stay
                    competitive, which results in different types of
                    modernization. These activities typically involve adding new
                    features, re-architecting the product for better technology
                    offering and cloud enablement. Upgrading the user interface
                    and mobile experience can be undertaken as product
                    modernization activity. Early adopting Big Data and Machine
                    Learning algorithms to get data-driven, actionable business
                    insights. Analyzing historical data to make right
                    predictions about the future can help the product to stay
                    ahead of competitors.
