          The initial expectations set were too hard to believe and sounded like a sales pitch. The journey thereafter was fun-filled and more ups than downs. At the end, we got what we asked for. A well-cooked and tested interface through using Angular, node. We'll look forward to repeating success with Prowerse on more opportunities.

          On time delivery and importantly at agreed costs. It was a simple task but I know a few out there that would have screwed it. Was also good to have single delivery spoc even after having Prowerse work on the mobile and web parts. Delighted to say the least.
